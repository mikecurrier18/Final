# This is Michael Currier's submission for the final project in class LIS4930 (Intro to Python). It is a task-tracker/to-do list app that uses a python file to create/remove tasks and load the application and a tasks.txt file to track/save the tasks externally. When the program is ran, the user can interact with the application through the console. Each time the program is ran, it loads the previous tasks that are saved in the tasks.txt file and updates any changes that are made to the file.

# The submission also includes the creation time of each task by importing datetime and treating each line from the text file as a segmented/mutatable tuble.
